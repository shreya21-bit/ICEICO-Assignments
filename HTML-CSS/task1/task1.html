                    <h4><u>WHAT IS THE BEAUTY OF NATURE ?</u></h4>
                    <p>“It is beautiful that nature is living, moving, and reproducing. Growth and development 
                        are often observed in nature, while the vast majority of man-made objects are static and 
                        deteriorating.” Nature offers the basic needs for humans to live – food, air, and water.</p><br><br>
        
                    <h4><u>HOW WE VALUE NATURE ?</u></h4>
                    <P>"If we start to understand the value of nature to our society and economy, we will recognise
                        he importance of living in harmony with nature, rather than destroying it for short term gain. 
                        So many governments and businesses around the world are now realising this, and starting to act –
                        it gives me real hope for the future."</P><br><br>
                    <h4><u>WHAT NATURE TEACHES US ?</u></h4>
                    <P>"Urge your readers to appreciate nature by recognizing concepts and ideas readily provided by nature.
                        For instance, the metamorphosis of a butterfly is a cycle that doesn’t only demonstrate a beautiful
                        transformation of a caterpillar to a butterfly but also teaches us that we can grow and improve 
                        ourselves in the future. "</P>
